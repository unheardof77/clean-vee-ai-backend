# Main Dockerfile for building the full application (multi-stage)
# This example builds all services using docker-compose, but you can use this Dockerfile to build a base image if needed.
FROM python:3.10-slim as base

# Set up a working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy shared code (if any)
COPY shared/ ./shared/

# Optionally, you can add build steps for each service here, or use docker-compose for multi-service orchestration.
# This Dockerfile is a placeholder for monorepo builds or CI/CD pipelines.

# Default command (no-op)
CMD ["bash"]
